[bed_mesh]
speed: 100 # Speed (mm/s) of non-probing moves during calibration. The default is 50.
mesh_min: 10, 18 # Nozze: 55.4, 18.2 - Probe Offset
#   Defines minimum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular beds. Relative to the probe's
#   location. Will be the first point probed, nearest to origin. Required for rectangular beds.
mesh_max: 174, 200 # Nozzle: 219.4, 210.2 - Probe Offset
#   Defines maximum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular beds. Adheres to the same
#   principle as mesh_min, however this will be the furthest point probed from the bed's origin.
#   Required for rectangular beds.
probe_count: 7,7
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer values X, Y defining the number
#   of points to probe along each axis. A single value is also valid, in which case that value will
#   be applied to both axes. Default is 3, 3.
algorithm: bicubic
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange" or "bicubic". This option will not
#   affect 3x3 grids, which are forced to use lagrange sampling. Default is lagrange.
#### Uses Default / Not Used ####
# horizontal_move_z: 5
#   Height (mm) that head should be commanded to move to just prior to starting a probe operation.
#   Default 5.
# fade_start: 1.0
#   Gcode Z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment when fade is enabled. Default 1.0.
# fade_end: 0.0
#   Gcode Z position in which phasing out completes. When set to a value below fade_start, fade is
#   disabled. Note that fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a print. If a user wishes
#   to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is recommended. Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
# fade_target:
#   Z position in which fade should converge. When value is set to a non-zero value it must be
#   within the range of z-values in the mesh. Users that wish to converge to the z homing position
#   should set this to 0. Default is the average z value of the mesh.
# split_delta_z: .025
#   Amount of Z difference (mm) along a move that will trigger a split. Default is .025.
# move_check_distance: 5.0
#   Distance (mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z. This is also the minimum length that a
#   move can be split. Default 5.0.
# mesh_pps: 2, 2
#   Comma separated pair of integers X, Y defining the number of points per segment to interpolate
#   in the mesh along each axis. A "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed point.
#   The user may enter a single value which will be applied to both axes. Default 2, 2.
# bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above may be applied to change the
#   amount of slope interpolated. Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which results
#   in more curvature in the mesh. Default .2.
# zero_reference_position:
#   Optional X,Y coordinate that specifies the location on the bed where Z = 0.  When specified
#   the mesh will be offset so that zero Z adjustment occurs at this location.  The default is
#   no zero reference.
# faulty_region_1_min:
# faulty_region_1_max:
#   Optional points that define a faulty region.  See docs/Bed_Mesh.md for details on faulty
#   regions.  Up to 99 faulty regions may be added. By default no faulty regions are set.
# adaptive_margin:
#   An optional margin (in mm) to be added around the bed area used by the defined print objects
#   when generating an adaptive mesh.
# scan_overshoot:
#  The maximum amount of travel (in mm) available outside of the mesh. For rectangular beds this
#  applies to travel on the X axis, and for round beds it applies to the entire radius.  The tool
#  must be able to travel the amount specified outside of the mesh.  This value is used to
#  optimize the travel path when performing a "rapid scan".  The minimum value that may be
#  specified is 1.  The default is no overshoot.
